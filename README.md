# Band-Website
This is a band website I built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

For this project, I decided to create a band website. For years, my band and I relied on sample websites like Linktree, as well as social media platforms such as Instagram, to promote our brand. This project gave me the opportunity to build our own website from the ground up and share our story in a more personalized way.

The website has five pages: Home, Members/Our Story, Music, Events, and Contact.

The Home page features a photo of the band, a brief mission statement, a link to our newly released music, and links to our social media.
The Members/Our Story page expands on our mission statement and goes in depth about the meaning behind our music. I also told a linear story of the band through photographs, and each member has their own description.
The Music page showcases the music we’ve released since the band’s inception.
The Events page highlights past shows as well as upcoming concerts.
The Contact page allows anyone to send the band an email about booking or anything else.

HTML:
header: to create consistency across each page.
nav: To allow a consistent space for users to navigate the website.
section: This provided an easy way to organize content and edit it in CSS.
img: This was used to display images throughout the website.
button: This was used along with the interactive elements that were created in JavaScript, such as "Scary Mode" and "Toggle Navigation."
a: This was used for hyperlinks across the website.
span: Used to highlight important text.

CSS:
A lavender background with a repeating image sets the overall theme.
Responsive layouts to ensure images, text, and sections look good across devices.
Consistent typography and spacing improve readability and flow.
Flexbox and simple hover effects give the navigation, events, and social media icons a polished, interactive feel.
Sections like About, Events, and Contact were styled with rounded corners, shadows, and subtle backgrounds to separate content and make the design approachable.



JavaScript:
toggleNavItems(): This was created to toggle on or off the navigation section in the website.
invertColors(): This was created to create the "Scary Mode" which is not too useful but a fun feature to invert the images to a negative and some of the other elements across the page.
